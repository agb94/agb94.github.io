I am delighted to announce that our paper titled ["FDG: A Precise Measurement of Fault Diagnosability Gain of Test Cases‚Äù](https://coinse.github.io/publications/pdfs/An2022pb.pdf) (Gabin An and Shin Yoo) has been accepted at ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2022)! This work proposes a novel measure FDG to quantify the fault diagnosability gain of individual test cases. Using the test coverage and the ongoing Fault Localisation (FL) results, FDG can precisely measure how much diagnosability gain each test can bring to the current test suite.
