The AutoFL work I mentioned back then was (thankfully?) accepted to FSE’24, and somewhere along the way it passed 100 citations (the LLM The LLM era moves fast 😳). A lot has happened since then, so here’s a quick roundup of the biggest changes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://coinse.github.io/2024/06/04/Gabin-PhD.html\">I completed my PhD in August 2024</a></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>A long journey finally came to an end. Finishing it felt both relieving and oddly emotional, and I’m grateful for all the people who supported me along the way. And.. I still miss COINSE!</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>I started a new job at <a href=\"https://www.roku.com/\">Roku</a> Seoul Office in June 2024</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I met lots of amazing people there, and the industry experience taught me a lot, and many of those lessons continue to help even now.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Since September 2025, I’ve been an <a href=\"https://ku-selene.github.io/\">Assistant Professor at Korea University</a></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This was a big decision I’d been contemplating for years, and I’m glad I made the leap back into academia. Being able to do research again (and teaching!) has been deeply satisfying.\nAdvising students has been refreshing and genuinely fun. I’m also thankful for everyone around me who has been incredibly supportive during this transition. 🥺</p>\n<p>These days, I had been working on multiple topics including <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22530\">AutoCrashFL</a> (essentially taking AutoFL ideas into real industrial crash debugging) and also exploring a few new research directions I’m excited about. I’m curious to see what kinds of work will come out over the next several years.</p>\n<p>I also attended <a href=\"https://conf.researchr.org/home/ase-2025\">ASE’25</a> in Seoul this year, my first in-person conference in a while. As a publicity co-chair, I was also the one behind the <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/aseconf.bsky.social\">ASE’25 Bluesky account</a> 😏 The SE community in the post-LLM era feels very different from before. It’s exciting that we can now tackle problems that once seemed impossible, but at the same time, the technical “uniqueness” of many approaches feels a bit blurred, so it’s becoming more important to carefully examine what the real contribution actually is.</p>\n<p>All in all, it has been a period full of change, both personally and academically.\nMaybe the next blog post will be in 2027… but hopefully I’ll have good news to share when it comes.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"🙋‍♀️ Life update","date":"November 20, 2025","description":null,"tags":["me"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/autofl/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"AutoFL: LLM-Based Fault Localization"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"75b285fc-e0df-5f42-bedd-22f4d8e80833","previousPostId":"07a8c1f5-144e-534d-91a5-573812fc9605","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1904069295","2841359383"]}
