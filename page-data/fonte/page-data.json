This work builds upon our previous research on <a href=\"https://coinse.github.io/publications/pdfs/An2021qb.pdf\">Reducing the Search Space of Bug Inducing Commits (BICs) Using Failure Coverage</a>, where we proposed a technique to narrow down the search space for bug-inducing commits using the coverage of failing executions. In this latest paper, we introduce a novel method, named Fonte, for quantifying the suspiciousness of commits, moving beyond mere search space reduction.</p>\n<p>Fonte is founded on a unique combination of Fault Localization (FL) and commit history mining. The core idea behind our approach is that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A commit is more likely to be a BIC if it introduced or modified code that is relevant to a particular failure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To measure the relevance of code elements to the observed failure, we employ Fault Localization techniques. We then devise a voting system wherein each code element ‚Äúvotes‚Äù for the commits that introduced or modified it. The voting power of a code element is determined by its FL ranking, with a decay factor applied to older commits. This decay factor stems from our hypothesis that older commits are less likely to be responsible for the current failure.</p>\n<p>Our evaluation demonstrates that Fonte is highly effective in identifying bug-inducing commits based on fault localization scores and exhibits superior performance compared to IR-based BIC identification techniques. The detailed results and findings can be found in our paper!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"[ICSE'23] Fonte: Finding Bug Inducing Commits from Failures","date":"February 01, 2023","description":null,"tags":["paper","research","bug inducing commit","industry collaboration","continuous integration"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/fdg/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[ISSTA'22] FDG: A Precise Measurement of Fault Diagnosability Gain of Test Cases"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"e859e98f-4599-5c67-a8af-15fd07ee1a3a","previousPostId":"a0d95ab6-3121-5757-8d38-a89dc60b51ea","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1904069295","2841359383"]}
