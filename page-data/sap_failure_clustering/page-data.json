This collaborative work, conducted in partnership with COINSE and SAP Labs Korea 😉, focuses on identifying the shared root causes among test failures. By accurately measuring the test failure similarity, we can group similar failures together when presenting them to developers and prevent an overwhelming number of bug reports. The study involves evaluating and comparing these similarity metrics using CI data from SAP HANA, a commercial database system. The investigation reveals that various information sources, such as static, dynamic, and historical data, complement each other, with the dynamic similarity metric performing best. I really look forward to presenting our work at ICSE 2022!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"[ICSE'22] Automatically Identifying Shared Root Causes of Test Breakages in SAP HANA","date":"May 01, 2022","description":null,"tags":["paper","research","failure clustering","industry collaboration"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new_beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/fdg/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[ISSTA'22] FDG: A Precise Measurement of Fault Diagnosability Gain of Test Cases"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8dadb8b2-aa53-54b9-ace2-9a2d4d4faed2","previousPostId":"86ed7049-765b-5bc9-89f6-8d4326cd2b48","nextPostId":"a0d95ab6-3121-5757-8d38-a89dc60b51ea"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1904069295","2841359383"]}
