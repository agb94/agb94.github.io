Our initial evaluation has yielded promising results: when provided with a single failing test (more specifically, its symptom and test snippet) and a set of basic functions for coverage retrieval and code navigation, AutoFL outperforms Spectrum-Based FL in terms of the number of perfect predictions.</p>\n<p>Feel free to check out our preprint for more details (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05487\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05487</a>), and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"AutoFL: LLM-Based Fault Localization","date":"August 12, 2023","description":null,"tags":["paper","research","fault localization","language model","ChatGPT"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/fonte/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[ICSE'23] Fonte: Finding Bug Inducing Commits from Failures"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"07a8c1f5-144e-534d-91a5-573812fc9605","previousPostId":"e859e98f-4599-5c67-a8af-15fd07ee1a3a","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1904069295","2841359383"]}
