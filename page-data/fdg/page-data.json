This work proposes a novel measure FDG to quantify the fault diagnosability gain of individual test cases. Using the test coverage and the ongoing Fault Localisation (FL) results, FDG can precisely measure how much diagnosability gain each test can bring to the current test suite.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"'FDG: A Precise Measurement of Fault Diagnosability Gain of Test Cases' is accepted at ISSTA 2022","date":"June 12, 2022","description":null,"tags":["paper","research","test suite quality"]}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"d98220c1-b960-5149-b099-77ae58d4693f","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1904069295","2841359383"]}
